Summary of my comprehensive analysis:

1. I compiled a comprehensive list of glycogenes from GlyGen database, focusing on glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which was saved as all_glycogenes.txt.

2. Through systematic analysis of glycogene-disease associations and glycosylation sites, I identified muscular dystrophy as the most promising disease model for RNA-seq analysis.

3. I performed differential expression analysis on the FSHD (Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) dataset (GSE140261) using DESeq2, which included 12 FSHD samples and 12 control samples.

4. My analysis identified 9,520 significantly differentially expressed genes (padj < 0.05) between FSHD and control samples.

5. I cross-referenced these results with my glycogene reference list, finding 856 matching glycogenes in the dataset.

6. Among these glycogenes, 449 showed significant differential expression (padj < 0.05), with 368 being up-regulated and 81 down-regulated in FSHD samples.

7. Notable up-regulated glycogenes included GALNT13 (log2FC = 6.01), GYG2 (log2FC = 5.89), and HAS1 (log2FC = 4.98), all with highly significant p-values.

8. Key down-regulated glycogenes included B3GALT1 (log2FC = -1.49), HAS3 (log2FC = -1.19), and ST3GAL1 (log2FC = -0.99).

9. I created comprehensive visualizations including a volcano plot and heatmap, which revealed distinct patterns of glycogene expression changes in FSHD.

10. The analysis suggests significant alterations in glycosylation-related pathways in FSHD, particularly in genes involved in protein glycosylation (GALNTs), hyaluronan synthesis (HAS genes), and sialylation (ST3GAL1), which may contribute to the disease pathology.
